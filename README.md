# FraudDetection-Financial-Model
Machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions for a financial company using transaction data.
# Fraud Detection Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent activities within transaction data.  
The objective is to accurately differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions, minimizing false positives while maximizing fraud detection rates.

This notebook covers:
- Data preprocessing
- Model building using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and ROC Curve
